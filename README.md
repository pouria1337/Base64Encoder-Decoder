# Base64Encoder/Decoder
An implementation of Base64 binary-to-text encoding & decoding protocol written in Python. As opposed to the built-in python module "base64", my script runs faster both in encoding and decoding text. 

# Usage
Simply download either .py file and type in your shell program of choice:
_python encoder.py

OR

_python3 encoder.py

A prompt asking you to enter an ascii text to be encoded or an encoded text to be decoded is then displayed. simply type/copy the desired text and press "Enter". An output is then displayed in the shell program.
